Warhammer Armies Project - 9.2.3
================================

# Presentation

This repository contains Battlescribe data files compatible with the [New Recruit roster editor][https://www.newrecruit.eu/app/MySystems]

These datafiles correspond to the 2.3 version of the Warhammer Armies Project.

# Development

The datafiles are still under heavy development. About 1 file every two or three week will be updated.
I usually update armies one by one, sometimes skipping special characters.

# Bug report

I haven't set up a bug reporting system yet. If you have a github account, or want to create one, you will be able to create an Issue, from a bug report template.
If you don't have a github account and don't want to create one : I will soon implement another way to report bugs, no worries.s
