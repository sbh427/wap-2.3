Warhammer Armies Project - 2.3
==============================

# Presentation

This repository contains Battlescribe data files compatible with the [New Recruit roster editor][https://www.newrecruit.eu/app/MySystems]

These datafiles correspond to the 2.3 version of the Warhammer Armies Project.

# Development

The datafiles are still under heavy development. About 1 file every two or three week will be updated.
I usually update armies one by one, sometimes skipping special characters.

# Usage

1. Open [New Recruit roster editor][https://www.newrecruit.eu/app/MySystems]. You don't need to create an account.
2. At the bottom of the list, click on "Add more games"
3. Then select "Add from github"
4. As version, select "custom", and enter "main". This is the most recent version, which will be regularly updated.
5. In repository, enter "sbh427/wap-2.3"
6. Click on the green +, wait until the files are uploaded in New Recruit
7. Start building your list !

# Bug report

I haven't set up a bug reporting system yet. If you have a github account, or want to create one, you will be able to create an Issue, from a bug report template.
If you don't have a github account and don't want to create one : I will soon implement another way to report bugs, no worries.s
