# Warhammer Armies Project - v9.2.3 (Unofficial Battlescribe & New Recruit Files)

## Overview

This repository contains **Battlescribe-compatible data files** for the [New Recruit roster editor](https://www.newrecruit.eu/app/MySystems), based on version **9.2.3** of the **Warhammer Armies Project** (WAP).

These files are **unofficial** and maintained by the community to help players use the latest army book updates in digital list-building tools.

---

## Development Status

The files are currently **under active development**. I typically update one army every 2–3 weeks. Updates are done army by army and may temporarily exclude special characters in early passes.
